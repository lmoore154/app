EXPLORER MODE
- Create a new Rails app (without the --api flag ... there's no database for this, so you can probably skip the --database=postgresql flag as well if you'd like.
- Create one controller (VisitorController) with one action. Make that your root route.
- Add a (blank) file named for your action into the appropriate view folder.
- Edit app/views/layouts/application.html.erb to remove the <%= yield %> block and to add the content you wish.
- Leave the rest of that file alone.
- Add your content to the page. Use at least 10 different HTML tags.
- Edit app/assets/stylesheets/application.css to add style to the page.
- Have fun!
- Push to GitHub and submit the link.

ADVENTURER MODE
- Experiment with centering content and making full-width strips of color across the page.
- Make incremental commits along the way rather than one big commit at the end.
- Try different HTML tags and play with CSS to see what creative ideas you can develop.
